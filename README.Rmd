This repostory uses [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) to ensure that the environment used by someone wishing to rerun the analysis is the same as that used to originally run it. First clone the repository, open up the R project then run:

```r
renv::restore()
```

We use [targets](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/) to ensure that the data analysis pipeline is reproducible. To rerun our analyses, run the following:

```r
targets::tar_make()
```

Below we visualise the process leading to the outputs of our analysis as a directed acyclic graph.

```{r}
library(targets)
tar_visnetwork(targets_only=TRUE)
```
